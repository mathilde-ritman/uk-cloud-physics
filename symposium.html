            <p class="text">
               The UK Early-Career Cloud Physics Group 2026 Symposium is a two-day research symposium on cloud physics. This event is for early-career researchers in the UK, which means that you are within 10 years of having completed your PhD (excluding career breaks).
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The goal is to foster knowledge, collaboration and community amongst us early-career cloud physicists in the UK.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              To achieve that, we’re inviting all attendees to present both a lightning talk, and an A4 poster introducing themselves and their research interests. We are also hosting two exciting keynote lectures on the current frontiers of the field. And, (arguably) most importantly, we are organising fun social and celebration activities to help ensure we get a chance to meet everyone in attendance.
            </p>
            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Expect exciting keynote lectures, lightning talks from all attendees, a chance to introduce yourself to the group and share your research and interests, and lots of time for networking.
              </p>
            <p class="text">
              Hosted with the magical backdrop of one of the oldest universities in the world, you can expect to make the most of the fun quicks of Oxford University dining and bootleg historical tours!

              <strong>What?</strong> keynote talks, lighning research talks from all participants, networking and more.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>Am I studying cloud physics?</strong>  Do you think you and/or your research would benefit from attending this symposium? Then yes!
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>Am I early career?</strong> Are you within 10 years of having completed your PhD (excluding career breaks)? Then yes!
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>Can I attend virtually?</strong> The point of this meeting is to build community, so we strongly encourage in-person attendance. That said, we want those who cannot attend in Oxford to be visible to the broader community. So virtual registrants are invited to provide an A4 poster introducing their research which will be shown at the meeting. Interactive virtual participation however will not be possible.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <strong>What will it cost?</strong> Registration will cover food and refreshments for the two days. Travel, accommodation on Thursday night and the Thursday night social will be at your own expense.
